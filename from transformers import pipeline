Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Applications of AI include expert systems, natural 
language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine vision.
The field of AI research was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a 
machine can be made to simulate it." AI has become an essential part of the technology industry, helping solve
problems in data analysis, healthcare,finance, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.Modern AI often involves 
machine learning (ML), where systems learn from data to improve performance over time.
Deep learning, a subfield of ML, uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.
Ethical concerns about AI include bias in algorithms, job displacement, and decision-making transparency.
 As AI continues to evolve, it's critical to ensure that these systems are developed and deployed responsibly.
Artificial Intelligence is not just a tool—it’s a transformation that challenges how we think, work, and live.
